    "- Use the `bulk_search` method when you need more than 1,000 results for a single query.\n",
    "- You can request between **1,000 and 10,000** results per query.\n",
    "- All parameters available in the standard `search` method—such as `expansions`, `include_companies`, `include_languages`, and more—are also supported in `bulk_search`.\n",
    "- A bulk search for 10,000 results typically completes in about 30 seconds or less."
