NOSIBLE Client Documentation
============================

Welcome to the NOSIBLE Client package! This documentation will give you an in-depth overview of the NOSIBLE Search
API, and show you how to harness the power of the NOSIBLE Search Engine.

Our mission is to be the undisputed **BEST** source of data for artificial intelligence agents
operating in the financial services sector. Engineered for quant funds and financial innovators
alike, Nosible makes it possible to build AI agents that are grounded in high-quality, verified
data.

Features
========

Search Capabilities
-------------------

- **Algorithm Selection:** You can switch between verbatim, lexical, semantic, hybrid, knowledge,
  agentic, and bespoke finance-optimized search algorithms, depending on your use case.

- **Query Expansion:** You can submit up to 10 related search terms in one shot to retrieve
  higher-quality search results. We will treat that as one API request, so it's a 10-for-1 special.

- **Native Pre-filtering:** You can filter your search results by specific publishers, date
  ranges, languages, and more without sacrificing search quality. We natively support
  pre-filtering.

- **Bulk Search:** You can retrieve up to 10,000 relevant search results for any search term
  using any search algorithm and filter. All of your search results will be securely hosted
  on S3.
